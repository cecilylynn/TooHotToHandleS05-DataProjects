# TooHotToHandleS05-DataProjects

"Too Hot To Handle" (THTH) is a Netflix reality dating show in which hot singles are living together but are not allowed to have any sexual contact. The Season 5 release date and time is July 14, 2023 at 3:01 am EDT. At that time, the first four episodes were released, with four more on July 21 and the last four on July 28.

The aim of this project is to perform time series analysis on the contestants follower counts to see how episode releases affect the metric. Side goals include comparing data between contestants and looking for correlations between factors relating to contestants' behavior on screen and their follower counts. A stretch goal is to identify which features have the biggest influence on follower growth and implement these features into a predictive model.

Analysis of this type is useful for influencers, reality tv stars, and media/entertainment companies in order to better understand how to effectively increase social media engagement.
